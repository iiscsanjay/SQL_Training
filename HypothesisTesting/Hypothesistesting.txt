 Attributes/Fields/Features : Columns

 - Numerical
    - Discrete : Integer Values (whole number -inf to inf)
        - Ratio :  num1/num2
        - interval :     5 * 10^230     1.65 x 10^16
    - Continuous :  Decimal values ( float,double)
 - Categorical
    - Ordinal : single Character kind of category : Grades (A,B,C,D)
    - nominal : String kind of category : India, USA

- Measure of Central Tendency
    - Mean : 
    - Median: Odd/Even
    - Mode : Maximum Frequency Data points
    - Standard Deviation (std) :  Sigma () = square root of Variance  
    - Variance = square of (Std)
- Measure of Variability

- Sampling Methods:
    - Probabilistic Sampling :
        - Simple random sampling:
        - Systematic Sampling : first sample is selected randomly, then fixed 
            interval samples are selected
        - Stratified Sampling : sub groups, maintain the same ratio for selecting samples
        - Cluster Sampling : divide the population into clusters and select one cluster randomly for analysis

    - Non-Probabilities Sampling
        - Convenience Sampling :
        - Quota Sampling :
        - Judgement 

Hypothesis :
    - Null Hypothesis
    - Alternative Hypothesis
Error:
    - Type 1 : Null Hypothesis is rejected when it is true. alpha
    - Type 2 : Null Hypothesis is accepted when it is false. beta

Statistics :
    T-Test:
        - One Sample Test t-Test: ( sample size < 30 )
            
            t = (xbar - mu ) / se

            xbar = is the sample mean
            mu = is the constant value for which we are doing obersvation
            
            Standard Error
                
                se = standard deviation of samples / sqrt( number of samples)

        - Two Sample Test t-Test:
        

    - Z-Test ( sample size  > 30 but if you know the population mean and Variance, you definitely perform z-test)

        zscore = xsample - mean / standard deviation 

        ZTest = xsMean - xPMean / (stdP / srqt(number of samples)) 
        
        One Sample Z-test:
        Two Sample Z-test:

    - Annova Test
        
        - One Way Annova :  3 or more groups
            
            stats.f_oneway()
            
        - Two/three/Four way annova :  3 or more groups (datasets)
            
            stats.annova_lm()

    - Chi-Square Test


Mean  = Summation of x / number of samples
Standard Deviation = sqrt(Summation(x - Xmean)^2/n)
Variance  = Summation(x - Xmean)^2/n
CoVariance = Summation(x-XMean) * (y-Ymean) / n
